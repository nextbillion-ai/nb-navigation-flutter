* Adapting to Android Kotlin Plugin 1.8.0+

## v2.0.0, Dec 13, 2024
### Breaking Changes
#### Bitcode Disabled:
The iOS navigation native framework has been updated to version v2.1.0, and Bitcode support has been disabled. This change is breaking for projects that require Bitcode.
- Ensure you update your project settings to account for the disabled Bitcode when integrating this framework version.
#### Android Gradle Plugin 8.0+ Support:
The Android navigation native framework has been updated to version v1.4.0 and now supports Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) 8.0+.
- If your project is using AGP 8.0 or above, please upgrade to this version.
### Changes
* Updated the iOS navigation native framework to version v2.1.0.
* Updated the Android navigation native framework to version v1.4.0.
* Added support for the 'allow' parameter in route request options.
* Add an avoidType field in the route request parameters to accept a List<String> as its type, which enhances support for the 'avoid' parameter.

## v1.0.1, Sept 6, 2024
* Update android native framework to 1.3.10

## v1.0.0, Sept 5, 2024
* Update the android navigation native framework to 1.3.9
* Update the iOS navigation native framework to 1.6.1
  * Remove NbmapDirections.xcframework from NbmapCoreNavigation and merged related classes into NbmapCoreNavigation.
  * Upgrade the dependency version of NBmaps.xcframework to 1.1.5
* Optimization: Simplified Route Switching Handling, by removing unnecessary list operations, the new code is more efficient.
  * Previous Implementation:
    * When a route was selected, the code moved the selected route to the beginning of the list and redrew the routes.
  * New Implementation:
    * Simplified the logic to just set primaryIndex to selectedRouteIndex.
      ```
        navNextBillionMap.addRouteSelectedListener(coordinates, (selectedRouteIndex) {
           if (routes.isNotEmpty) {
             primaryIndex = selectedRouteIndex;
           }
        });
      ```
* Bug Fix: Primary Route Selection
  * Issue: The selected route was not being used as the primary route; the default behavior was always using routes.first.
  * Fix: Updated the configuration to support the selected route as the primary route.
    ```
      NavigationLauncherConfig config = NavigationLauncherConfig(route: selectedRoute, routes: routes);
    ```
